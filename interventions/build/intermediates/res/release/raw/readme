		<h2>README</h2>
		<p>
			<i>Interventions</i> is a sample application i wrote to keep track of
			assistance interventions. It may be used for any other activity which
			involves spending time for customers, friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can record the customer name, starting time and ending time. Any intervention
			can also be marked for call charging, extra charging and set to already billed.

			from the contact list, being able to take advantage of its search functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application database can be exported to an XML or CSV file, for backup purposes
			and integration with other programs (CSV format is suitable for OpenOffice /LibreOffice CALC).
